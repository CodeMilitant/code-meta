== Description ==

CodeMeta OpenGraph Meta Tag Generator by CodeMilitant

This could easily be the single most important WordPress plugin you can install for your WordPress site ... and it's free!

The goal of code should be to work for us, with little to no intervention from the user. This simple philosophy is the way code/computers are supposed to work.

This plugin is designed to provide comprehensive meta tag solutions for maximum SEO results.

CodeMeta is focused on content creators such as the photographer, musician and videographer by including vital EXIF information in the meta tags. This will directly help combat "deep fakes" to protect your intellectual property in the public square.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do for my website? =

For your website to achieve top search engine rankings, every post type (posts, pages, projects and products) must have at least 300 words of content and associated categories and tags must be assigned to each type.

CodeMeta builds the Opengraph meta tags the search engines use to help rank your website. There's no way to have a top ranked website without Opengraph meta tags.

= Will the CodeMeta plugin build the Opengraph meta for my media files? =

Yes! In fact, it builds a complete array of all media files found on the page. This includes images, audio and video.

It even helps with "deep fakes", as mentioned above.

= Will this work with custom post types? =

CodeMeta tries hard to work with every post type, but that depends on the structure of the post type.

CodeMeta tries to parse all post types, however, it may not get everything right. The public GitHub (below) is available should you have any troubles with a custom post type.

= Where do I setup the parameters for this plugin after it's installed? =

There are no paramters to setup. Just install, activate and forget about it.

The admin screen in the CodeMeta menu will show you a sample of the actual meta tags generated from a random post type found on your website.

= Will CodeMeta work with all ecommerce plugins? =

No, this plugin is only optimized for WooCommerce. Future premium versions may encompass more ecommerce solutions.

= Will CodeMeta help me build categories and keywords from my WordPress content? =

Yes! The CodeSEO AI premium version builds the categories and keyword phrases for a small monthly fee.

= Will this CodeMeta plugin show my existing keywords and categories? =

Yes, but you have to add all these elements manually to your WordPress content. The CodeSEO AI premium version will do this for you for a small monthly fee.

= Will the CodeMeta plugin connect my social networks to my website? =

Yes, the social network premium version is only $3 dollars (USD) per month for social network integration.

= Will this generate Opengraph meta tags for media EXIF information? =

Yes, all image, audio and video files containing relevant EXIF information will be displayed in the Opengraph meta tags.

An array of Opengraph meta tags will be generated for all media found in the post.

= Does this plugin work with other Opengraph meta tag (SEO) generators? =

No, because other plugins produce basic meta tags, they will conflict with one another.

= Does CodeMeta add records to my database? =

No, the content is efficiently generated through PHP and will persistently remain using any server or WordPress caching.
